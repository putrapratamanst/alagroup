Limit user registrations to domain names on a whitelist.

== Description ==

For an internal or private Wordpress installation you may want to place restrictions on
who can register a user account. This plugin allows the administrator to specify a 
'whitelist' of domain names and restricts registrations to email addresses from those
whitelisted domains.

Please Note: This plugin is only tested on PHP5 and may not work on earlier versions.
